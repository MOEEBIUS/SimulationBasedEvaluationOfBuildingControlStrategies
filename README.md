# Simulation-based Evaluation of Control Strategies in Buildings

## Description
We use an MCDA algorithm (PROMETHE II) for evaluating a set of pre-defined control strategies on a building simulation model. The Decision Maker than can decide on which strategy to apply to the building (e.g. for the following day).
